# CryptoDashboard
I have shared with you a Dashboard, blockchain integration and front end part that I created for you to follow your crypto coins, with the hope that it will help you.

In this program, we created a dashboard to keep track of cryptocurrency records using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Solidity.

The JavaScript code defined an object to store the records, and two functions: addRecord and getRecords. The addRecord function takes a currency and an amount as arguments, and updates the records with the new information. The getRecords function logs the records to the console.

The Solidity code defined a contract with a mapping to store the records, and two functions: addRecord and getRecord. The addRecord function takes an address and an amount as arguments, and updates the records with the new information. The getRecord function takes an address as an argument and returns the corresponding record.
